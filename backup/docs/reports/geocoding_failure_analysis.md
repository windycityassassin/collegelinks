   - Informal landmarks
   - Poor address standardization

### 3.2 Technical Issues
1. API-Related (11 cases)
   - Rate limiting: 3 cases
   - Timeouts: 8 cases
   
2. Validation Failures (12 cases)
   - Coordinate bounds
   - Address format validation
   - Confidence thresholds

## 4. Specific Problem Cases

### 4.1 Notable Examples
1. Missing Coordinates
   ```
   - Sikkim International University
     Issue: Incomplete address, multiple reported locations
   - University of Science & Technology, Meghalaya
     Issue: Ambiguous campus location, poor landmark data
   - The Global Open University
     Issue: Multiple address formats, temporary locations
   ```

2. Low Confidence Scores
   ```
   - Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University
     Issue: Multiple institutions with same name
   - Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University
     Issue: Multiple campuses, administrative changes
   - Tamil Nadu Teacher Education University
     Issue: Address ambiguity, shared facilities
   ```

## 5. Common Address Problems

### 5.1 Format Issues
1. Postal Codes
   - Missing: 43 institutions
   - Invalid: 12 institutions
   - Mismatched: 8 institutions

2. District Information
   - Missing: 89 institutions
   - Ambiguous: 34 institutions
   - Incorrect: 15 institutions

3. Multiple Formats
   - Inconsistent separators: 67 cases
   - Mixed languages: 23 cases
   - Different ordering: 19 cases

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 Data Collection Improvements
1. Standardize Address Collection
   - Implement structured address forms
   - Enforce postal code validation
   - Require district information

2. Enhanced Validation
   - Cross-reference with postal database
   - Implement landmark verification
   - Add manual verification for low confidence cases

### 6.2 Technical Enhancements
1. Geocoding Process
   - Implement address preprocessing
   - Add local landmark database
   - Enhance confidence scoring algorithm

2. API Handling
   - Improve rate limit handling
   - Implement better fallback options
   - Add retry mechanisms

### 6.3 Quality Assurance
1. Manual Review Process
   - Review all low confidence results
   - Verify multiple campus locations
   - Cross-check renamed institutions

2. Data Maintenance
   - Regular updates to landmark database
   - Monitor address changes
   - Track institution relocations

## 7. Next Steps

### 7.1 Immediate Actions
1. Address the 57 failed geocoding cases
   - Collect missing information
   - Verify current locations
   - Update address formats

2. Review Low Confidence Results
